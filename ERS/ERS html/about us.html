The employee management system will benefit our local managers , our local opportunities and
our economy by growing businesses. This will be done by encouraging the creation of more job
opportunities , stabilising the economy by having steady business growth and improving
business growth by helping our managers.

The Employee Record System is not a complex system. It has basic functionalities such
as the CRUD functions , Database connectivity and security. Since it is to keep records
and nothing more we chose not to complicate the system and also because of the limited
time given to complete the project
