The system proposed is a web-based application that has been programmed using
basic programming languages namely: PHP, JAVA SCRIPT and HTML. The software will be
able to run and function on any laptop or computer that is running basic operating systems such
as MAC-OS, Windows, Linux and Ubuntu basically any OS that can run a server-based database
application and a browser. In order for a user or developer to edit the program , they will need an
IDE that can edit multiple programming languages, I recommend Visual Studio.
