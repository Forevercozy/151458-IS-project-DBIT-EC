    Good Business management is one of the major backbones of effectively running a business ,
    gaining profitability and helping to improve economic stability as a whole. One of the ways to
    promote good business management is having an easy way to store, update and record employee
    data . This will help managers reduce time wastage by keeping records in an analogue manner
    while also helping them focus on more pressing issues.
    Local managers do not have a way to keep track of their employee count thus making them lose
    on a lot of good business aspects due to lack of proper management. Due to this the entire
    economy as a whole loses out. Businesses do not gain growth meaning no economic growth thus
    no Job opportunities. In order for us to solve this, I believe helping managers better manage their
    business in terms of their Employee management can increase business growth and down the line
    , country - wide economic growth. Even though this will prove quite helpful , we might still face
    some challenges as this is the nature of things; most local managers do not have access to IT
    based machinery such as laptops and computers and also might not have enough funds to
    purchase systems of small or large magnitudes. To help on this, I recommend considering the
    pricing factor and reducing the price of the system quite much just for the sake.
    My proposed system, the Employee Record System , will assist local managers in business
    management and hopefully with them achieving great management , our whole economy will
    benefit. </p>
